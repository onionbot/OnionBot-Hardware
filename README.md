### About 
OnionBot tackles the challenge of automating pan cooking. Cooking progress is tracked by a Raspberry Pi 4, using a wide-angle camera and thermal camera mounted above the induction cooker. Recipes are processed by a Python script, and a servo motor directly drives the stove control knob to adjust the power setting.

*The final hardware design was reached through several prototype iterations, improving aesthetic design, signal interference, and lens condensation issues. The electronics are displayed on a board to help make understanding more accessible.*

The goal of this project is automation without unnecessary complexity. After all, we are not replacing the chef but giving them multi-tasking superpowers! Since there is no actuator more flexible and dextrous than the human, a touch screen interface called ‘sous-chef’ shows instructions, reminders, and alerts. OnionBot watches the pan so that you can focus on culinary creativity!

### Required components

### Known issues 

- Sensor assembly gets in the way of cooking, should be wall/upper cupboard mounted higher up
- Total build cost is currently very high, needs to be iterated down to maker-friendly price
- Print requires modification before parts fit 
- Blower is way oversized making overall assembly large. 

### TODO 

- Explore building into a cheap IKEA hob to bring cost down
- Design new maker-friendly easily printable parts 

### The OnionBot idea was developed through a research project at Imperial College London
